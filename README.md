Short pipeline that runs two disease-agnostic transmission models: an SIR-style population based model, and a basic individual-based model. 

The purpose is two fold: 1) to explore the extent to which super-simple individual-based models reflect the dynamics of population based models, and 2) to allow the user to play, break, and expand either model, whilst visualising the effects.

Anyone is free to use and adapt this code for use in infectious disease modelling training material.
